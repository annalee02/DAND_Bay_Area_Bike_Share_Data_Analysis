# DAND_Bay_Area_Bike_Share_Data_Analysis
Welcome to the Nanodegree - Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree Project

## Project Overview
In this project, I put myself in the shoes of a data analyst performing an exploratory analysis on the data. I took a look at two of the major parts of the data analysis process: **data wrangling** and **exploratory data analysis**. 

## About
Bay Area Bike Share is a company that provides on-demand bike rentals for customers in San Francisco, Redwood City, Palo Alto, Mountain View, and San Jose. Users can unlock bikes from a variety of stations throughout each city, and return them to any station within the same city. Users pay for the service either through a yearly subscription or by purchasing 3-day or 24-hour passes. Users can make an unlimited number of trips, with trips under thirty minutes in length having no additional charge; longer trips will incur overtime fees.
